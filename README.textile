h1. Imgur-Directory-Listing

This is a directory listing app for people with slow upload speeds. Each image in the images directory is uploaded to "imgur.com":imgur.com and each link on the site redirects users to "imgur.com":http://imgur.com.

h1. How does it work?

It's using incron, to add an image to the database (and to "imgur.com":http://imgur.com), each time it's added to the images directory. 

h2. Requirements
* rails 2.3
* incron installed
* imgur, mime-types, will_paginate, sqlite3-ruby (or other db) gems installed

bc. gem install imgur
gem install mime-types
gem install will_paginate
gem install sqlite3-ruby

h2. What have I stolen/used?
* "pilu's web app theme":http://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme/
* "qtip's image preview on hover":http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/content/images

h2. Installation

In the folder:

bc. rake db:migrate

Create a file in /etc/incron.d/ directory and add following lines to it:

bc. /image/dir IN_CREATE,IN_MOVED_TO,IN_MOVED_FROM,IN_DELETE /path/to/app/script/runner 'Image.read_dir' $#

note: that $# is not needed, but incron doesn't work without it

p. And temporary you have to set images_path variable in app/model/image.rb
