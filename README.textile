h1. Imgur-Directory-Listing

This is a directory listing app for people with slow upload speeds. Each image in the images directory is uploaded to "imgur.com":imgur.com and each link on the site redirects users to "imgur.com":http://imgur.com.

h1. How does it work?

It's using incron, to add an image to the database (and to "imgur.com":http://imgur.com), each time it's added to the images directory. 

h2. Requirements
* incron installed
* imgur gem installed
@gem install imgur@
* mime-types gem installed
@gem install mime-types@

h2. Installation

Create a file in /etc/incron.d/ directory and add following lines to it:

bc. /image/dir IN_CREATE,IN_MOVED_TO,IN_MOVED_FROM,IN_DELETE /path/to/app/script/readdir $#

p. And temporary you have to set images_path variable in app/model/image.rb
